# ⚠️ OBSOLETE - This Guide is No Longer Applicable

**This guide is for Prisma ORM, which has been replaced by Sequelize.**

The Yellow Cross platform has been migrated from Prisma to Sequelize ORM.

## Current ORM: Sequelize

Please refer to:
- `docs/guides/SEQUELIZE_GUIDE.md` - For Sequelize usage guide
- `docs/architecture/SEQUELIZE_MIGRATION.md` - For migration details

## What Changed

- **Before**: Prisma ORM with schema-first approach
- **After**: Sequelize ORM with TypeScript decorators and class-based models

All feature modules now use Sequelize models located in:
- `backend/src/models/sequelize/`
