## Technical Details

### Component Structure
Each feature page component follows this pattern:
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { subFeaturesData } from '../../shared/utils/featuresData';

const FeaturePage: React.FC = () => {
  const subFeatures = subFeaturesData['feature-slug'] || [];
  
  return (
    <div className="feature-page">
      {/* Hero section with icon and description */}
      {/* Sub-features grid */}
      {/* Call-to-action section */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Routing Pattern
Each feature has two routes:
```typescript
<Route path="feature-slug" element={<PrivateRoute><FeaturePage /></PrivateRoute>} />
<Route path="feature-slug/:subFeature" element={<PrivateRoute><SubFeaturePage /></PrivateRoute>} />
```

### Sub-Features Data
Each feature includes detailed sub-features:
```typescript
'feature-slug': [
  { 
    id: 1, 
    name: 'Sub-Feature Name', 
    description: 'Description', 
    slug: 'sub-feature-slug', 
    featureSlug: 'feature-slug' 
  },
  // 4-6 sub-features per feature
]
```

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/app/App.tsx**
   - Added imports for 45 new feature components
   - Added 90 new routes (2 per feature: main + sub-feature)

2. **frontend/src/shared/utils/featuresData.ts**
   - Added 45 features to featuresData array
   - Added 220+ sub-features across all features
   - File size: ~1900 lines

3. **frontend/src/shared/types/index.ts**
   - Extended Feature.category type to include new categories

4. **frontend/src/shared/api/client.ts**
   - Fixed TypeScript type errors with headers

5. **45 New Component Files**
   - Created in respective feature directories
   - Consistent naming and structure

## Quality Assurance

### TypeScript Compilation ✅
```bash
npm run lint:frontend
# Result: No errors
```

### Production Build ✅
```bash
npm run build:react
# Result: Successfully built in 1.73s
# Bundle: 364.46 kB (81.65 kB gzipped)
```

### Code Quality
- All components use TypeScript
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper React patterns (functional components, hooks)
- Type-safe props and exports

## Platform Status

### Before Implementation
- **Total Features**: 60 (backend complete)
- **Frontend Features**: 15
