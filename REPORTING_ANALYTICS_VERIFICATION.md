3. Re-run the reporting endpoints to see populated data

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a sample case
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cases/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Sample Case",
    "clientName": "Test Client",
    "matterType": "Civil",
    "practiceArea": "Litigation",
    "estimatedValue": 50000,
    "actualValue": 55000,
    "createdBy": "Test User"
  }'

# Run case analytics to see the data
curl http://localhost:3000/api/reports/case-analytics
```
