- Relationships and references
- Validation constraints at model level
- Database indexes for performance
- Virtual properties for computed fields
- Instance methods for entity-specific operations

```

**2. Validation Layer (Joi Schemas)**
```javascript
- Input validation schemas (4-9 per feature)
- Type checking and constraints
- Business rule enforcement
- Data sanitization
- Custom validation messages
```

**3. Business Logic Layer (Express Routes)**
```javascript
- Database connection checks
- Input validation with Joi
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Sub-feature specific endpoints
- Search and filter capabilities
- Analytics and reporting endpoints
- Error handling with try-catch
- Consistent response formatting
```
