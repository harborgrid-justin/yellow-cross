## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Models
- **ORM:** Sequelize with TypeScript decorators
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Table Naming:** Snake case (e.g., `litigation_matters`, `family_law_cases`)
- **Field Types:** UUID (primary keys), VARCHAR, TEXT, DATE, DECIMAL, ENUM, JSONB, ARRAY
- **Indexes:** Added on frequently queried fields (status, unique numbers, case types)

### Common Fields Across All Models
- `id`: UUID primary key with auto-generation
- Unique identifier field (varies by model: caseNumber, matterNumber, etc.)
- `status`: ENUM field for tracking state
- `createdBy`, `updatedBy`: Audit trail fields
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Automatic timestamps
- `notes`: TEXT field for additional information

### API Endpoints
Each feature implements 5 standard RESTful endpoints:
1. **POST /create** - Create new record with validation
2. **GET /:id** - Retrieve specific record
3. **PUT /:id** - Update existing record
4. **GET /** - List all records with pagination
5. **DELETE /:id** - Soft delete/archive record

### Validation
- Joi validation schemas for input validation
- Required field enforcement
- ENUM validation for status and type fields
- Date validation where applicable

### Error Handling
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Descriptive error messages
- Database connection status checking
- Not found handling (404 responses)

### Features
- Graceful degradation when database is not connected
- Capability display mode when offline
- Unique number generation with prefix and random suffix
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage
- Order by createdAt DESC for list endpoints
