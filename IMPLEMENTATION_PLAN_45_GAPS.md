## Conclusion

This 12-week plan addresses all 45 identified gaps in a structured, phased approach. Critical security and authentication gaps are addressed first (Weeks 1-2), followed by essential infrastructure (Weeks 3-7), and finally UI completion and enhancements (Weeks 8-12).

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 implementation immediately with authentication and security features.
