## Time Tracking & Entry

### Creating a Simple Time Entry

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/billing/time-entry \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "attorneyName": "Jane Smith",
    "caseNumber": "CASE-2024-12345",
    "clientName": "Acme Corporation",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "hours": 2,
    "minutes": 30,
    "description": "Reviewed contract documents and drafted memorandum",
    "taskType": "Document Review",
    "billable": true,
    "billingRate": 250,
    "createdBy": "jane.smith"
  }'
```

### Creating Time Entry with Rounding

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/billing/time-entry \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "attorneyName": "John Doe",
    "caseNumber": "CASE-2024-12346",
    "clientName": "Widget Inc",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "hours": 0,
    "minutes": 23,
    "description": "Phone consultation with client",
    "taskType": "Phone Call",
    "billable": true,
    "billingRate": 300,
    "roundingRule": "6 Minutes",
    "createdBy": "john.doe"
  }'
```
**Result**: 23 minutes will be rounded up to 24 minutes (4 billing increments of 6 minutes)

### Bulk Time Entry

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/billing/time-entry/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entries": [
      {
        "attorneyName": "Jane Smith",
        "caseNumber": "CASE-2024-12345",
        "date": "2024-01-15",
        "hours": 1,
        "description": "Legal research",
        "taskType": "Legal Research",
        "billable": true,
        "billingRate": 250,
        "createdBy": "jane.smith"
      },
      {
        "attorneyName": "Jane Smith",
        "caseNumber": "CASE-2024-12345",
        "date": "2024-01-15",
        "hours": 2,
        "description": "Document drafting",
        "taskType": "Document Drafting",
        "billable": true,
        "billingRate": 250,
        "createdBy": "jane.smith"
      }
    ],
    "applyRounding": true,
    "roundingRule": "6 Minutes",
    "createdBy": "jane.smith"
  }'
```
