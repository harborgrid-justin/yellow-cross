## Secrets Management

### Current Status
- ✅ No secrets in code
- ✅ `.env` in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `.env.example` with dummy values
- ✅ Environment variables documented

### Secrets Checklist
- ✅ JWT_SECRET must be changed in production
- ✅ JWT_REFRESH_SECRET must be changed in production
- ✅ POSTGRES_PASSWORD must be changed in production
- ✅ API keys documented but not committed
- ✅ SMTP credentials documented but not committed

### Recommendations
- Use secret management tools (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Rotate secrets regularly (90 days)
- Use different secrets per environment
- Never log secrets

---

## Data Protection

### At Rest
- ✅ Database passwords hashed with bcrypt
- ✅ PostgreSQL SSL connections required
