   - First 4 sub-features shown with checkmarks
   - "+4 more..." indicator for remaining sub-features

2. **Dashboard Section**:

   - Search and filter functionality
   - Category-based filtering

3. **API Explorer**:

### Sub-Feature Visibility
All 120 sub-features are accessible:
- **Primary Display**: First 4 sub-features visible on each card
